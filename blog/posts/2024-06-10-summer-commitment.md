Not gonna lie — I've been pretty lazy these past few days. Haven't really built anything new, and I can feel that itch to start creating again. I think it's easy to get stuck in the loop of comfort, especially after finishing a big project like the FRC Scouting App. But that's not why I'm here this summer.

Starting today, I'm committing to building **every single day**. No exceptions. Whether it's pushing code, debugging something new, or learning a technical concept — I'm sprinting this summer. I'll be using GitHub daily again, consistently committing and updating progress. I want to treat this like a personal bootcamp.

A few key goals I've laid out for myself:

- ✅ **Finish the FRC Design course** – I've been meaning to get through it to deepen my understanding of robot design principles.
    
- ✅ **100 Days of Swift** – I'm restarting this seriously. I want to have iOS development in my back pocket and push another wellness-based app by the end of summer.
    
- ✅ **Master FRC Command Scheduler** – Specifically the `ParallelCommandGroup`, `DeadlineGroup`, and all the async intricacies that come with it. My goal is to be able to build clean, scalable autonomous modes.
    
- ✅ **High-Powered Rocket Project** – This is going to be one of the cooler builds we've taken on. I want to help my club members actually _launch_ something big this summer. I'll take on the technical documentation and help guide the flight software + testing.
    

This summer is my reset button. Back to the grind. Back to building.

Let's go.
