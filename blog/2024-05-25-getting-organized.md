Spent the early part of my day learning about Obsidian and how to properly use the application to keep track of my accomplishments and progress throughout the summer. Specifically these two videos helped me: [Obsidian Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x5ua7LecOI), [Obsidian Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR5-0XDkwU0). After realizing the importance of being organized again, I cleaned up my GitHub and pushed all commits that were just sitting idle locally.

Spent today mostly planning my days throughout the summer. Defined my goals and tech stack I want to use to approach building my FRC Scouting App which will be powered by AI. Specifically, I created this goal in mind after watching my team struggle with scouting. By no means is this to replace conventional scouters, as it will open source and free for all. This application will merely serve to aid scouting leads or teams that are new to FIRST and need strategies to jump start their brain.

Outside of a robotics context, I also defined our goals for BAAP for the summer, about a week ago: [[BAAP Off-Season preperation]]. I also focused on areas that I believed were going to be issues throughout the season, allowing me to better micromanage those areas and having a dedicated place to monitor those updates.

Excluding anything academically, I played a little golf today with my friends and went out to eat with my family. 

Goodnight.
