## June 15, 2024 - Getting Organized and Planning

Spent the early part of my day learning about Obsidian and how to properly use the application to keep track of my accomplishments and progress throughout the summer. Specifically these two videos helped me: [Obsidian Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x5ua7LecOI), [Obsidian Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR5-0XDkwU0). After realizing the importance of being organized again, I cleaned up my GitHub and pushed all commits that were just sitting idle locally.

Spent today mostly planning my days throughout the summer. Defined my goals and tech stack I want to use to approach building my FRC Scouting App which will be powered by AI. Specifically, I created this goal in mind after watching my team struggle with scouting. By no means is this to replace conventional scouters, as it will open source and free for all. This application will merely serve to aid scouting leads or teams that are new to FIRST and need strategies to jump start their brain.

Outside of a robotics context, I also defined our goals for BAAP for the summer, about a week ago: [[BAAP Off-Season preperation]]. I also focused on areas that I believed were going to be issues throughout the season, allowing me to better micromanage those areas and having a dedicated place to monitor those updates. [[BAAP Things to Monitor]]

Excluding anything academically, I played a little golf today with my friends and went out to eat with my family.

## June 16, 2024 - FRC Scouting Web App Completion

Finished my FRC-Scouting Web App. This was a large project if I'm being honest, took me a solid two days to build this large app. The frontend was react and vite, something im semi familiar with but the backend was a doozy. I had previously used node.js and express but integrating a LLM request was something I had never done before. Tried OpenAI and then realized I had to pay, so I decided to use Groq and their free llama model. By no means is it better, but with enough context, the model performs decent. This isn't created to replace actual strategy, but only to supplement it or give a starting point. I do admit, I did vibe code a little throughout this, especially towards the part where I had to deploy to Vercel (I didn't want to do all that work). But it worked out in the end. By no means is it done though, I need to fix it on the LLM integration on mobile, as it will only work on desktop currently for some reason.

## June 17, 2024 - New Project Ideas

I'm thinking of starting on another Swift app, this one again more focused on health and wellness. The issue is I can't publish an app on the App Store for anything less than $100. It's kind of annoying.

I will be building a sentiment analyzer for stocks. Obviously parsing through each and every stock is not viable, it will break my limit for where I host it. I'm thinking of selecting a few stocks or maybe just having it on a rotation based on which stock is being talked about the most in the news and X. In addition, after I get the sentiment analyzer going, I'm gonna have the program look at technical indicators. Things such as P/E, Volume, and dividend. Most important is the trading volume, as with heavy sentiment that will fluctuate a lot.

## June 18, 2024 - Summer Commitment

Not gonna lie — I've been pretty lazy these past few days. Haven't really built anything new, and I can feel that itch to start creating again. I think it's easy to get stuck in the loop of comfort, especially after finishing a big project like the FRC Scouting App. But that's not why I'm here this summer.

Starting today, I'm committing to building **every single day**. No exceptions. Whether it's pushing code, debugging something new, or learning a technical concept — I'm sprinting this summer. I'll be using GitHub daily again, consistently committing and updating progress. I want to treat this like a personal bootcamp.

A few key goals I've laid out for myself:

- ✅ **Finish the FRC Design course** – I've been meaning to get through it to deepen my understanding of robot design principles.
- ✅ **100 Days of Swift** – I'm restarting this seriously. I want to have iOS development in my back pocket and push another wellness-based app by the end of summer.
- ✅ **Master FRC Command Scheduler** – Specifically the `ParallelCommandGroup`, `DeadlineGroup`, and all the async intricacies that come with it. My goal is to be able to build clean, scalable autonomous modes.
- ✅ **High-Powered Rocket Project** – This is going to be one of the cooler builds we've taken on. I want to help my club members actually _launch_ something big this summer. I'll take on the technical documentation and help guide the flight software + testing.

This summer is my reset button. Back to the grind. Back to building.

Let's go.
